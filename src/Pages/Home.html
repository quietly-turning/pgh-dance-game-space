    PGH Dance Game Space

  <p>
    The PGH Dance Game Space is a community center for dance gamers and dance-game-adjacent-folk.
  </p>
  <p>
    We get together twice a week to share freeplay dance games, board games, food, and
    and one another's company.

  <p>
    The primary goal of <span class="fst-italic">The Space</span> is to be a gathering place
    where the local Pittsburgh dance game community can meet meet and engage — to ensure each
    person can socialize, have a meal, and express themselves to the extent they are comfortable
    — in a safe and supportive environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The secondary goals of <span class="fst-italic">The Space</span> include providing the local
    Pittsburgh dance game community with a place to play rhythm games, and providing the broader
    global dance game community a place to host events.
