  <h2 id="About">About</h2>
  <p>
    The PGH Dance Game Space is a Pittsburgh-based community center for dance gamers and
    dance-game-adjacent folk.
  </p>
  <p>
    We get together twice a week to share freeplay dance games, board games, food, and
    and one another's company.

    The primary goal of <span class="fst-italic">The Space</span> is to provide a gathering place
    where the local dance game community can meet meet and engage, such that each person
    can socialize, have a meal, and express themselves in a safe and supportive environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The secondary goals of <span class="fst-italic">The Space</span> include providing the local
    Pittsburgh dance game community with a place to play rhythm games, and providing the broader
    global dance game community a permanent location equipped to host events.
